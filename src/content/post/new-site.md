The first version of the Visual Voyager web site started in 2019. It was written in Wordpress, and the current design dates from 2020.

Over the years, additional features have been added to the web site, such as discussion forums and membership subscription options. In truth, the site had become a bit complex and bloated, which impacted performance.

We have taken the liberty to redevelop the site using the latest web development technologies, which will make the site faster, easier to maintain, and more secure. The site design has also been revamped, and we hope you will like the ease of use and simpler navigation.

The redeveloped web site is based on [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org). In particular, it is written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), HTML and [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev) based on the [Astro](https://stro.build) framework, and deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
