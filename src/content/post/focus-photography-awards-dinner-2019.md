The Focus Awards are held annually to celebrate the best talent in the Focus Photographers Group. Submitted images are judged by a panel of industry professionals and awards are presented in various categories with Image of the Year and Photographer of the Year the highest accolades. The annual dinner is the marquee event of the year and brings members together to celebrate the year, and congratulate the winners. I attended the dinner as a guest for one of the sponsors of the event Mainline Photographics.

The Focus Seascape and Landscape Photography Incorporation (Focus Photographers) was formed in Sydney, Australia in 2012. It provides an opportunity for members of the community with a wide range of experience and interest to come together regularly to share, learn, and develop photographic skills in an fun environment that is mutually supportive and committed to exploring the creative and documentary potential of photography.

The annual Focus Awards is now one of the most popular and most valuable amateur landscape photography competitions in Australia. In 2018 it attracted 2,190 entries and a total prize pool valued at more than $40,000.

The Focus Awards are designed to encourage photographers at all stages of development to improve their skills and confidence.

As such, every entry into the Focus Awards receives a judges’ aggregate score and a feedback comment. Gold, Silver and Bronze Certificates are assigned to images that achieve the requisite score. These features set the Focus Awards apart from most other leading photography competitions.
