A photography mentor for women running New Zealand’s only organisation providing photography workshops, networking events and tours for women.

Since I was born, I’ve either been in front or behind a camera; it’s like photography is in my blood.

In 2017, I was extremely fortunate to be one of 10 Auckland photographers mentored by industry luminary photographer Tom Ang as part of the “Connections – Peace" where two of my photographs were chosen to be included in this exhibition displayed at Queens Wharf in Auckland.

As a photographer, I now combine my passion to deliver photography tours, workshops, field trips and social photography events for women.
