The Sony Alpha 1 camera came into my life in March 2021, and it's now March 2022. I have been using this extraordinary camera almost exclusively since then. I have shown you use of the camera in a variety of contexts, including studio flash. I have only shot stills, because I don't shoot video. I thought I should summarise my thoughts about this camera after using it to take over a hundred thousand images.

Here are the articles I've written so far about the A1, or using the A1. There are more than I remembered, but some are just a few images.

## How do I feel about the A1 now?

I've said it before: the A1 is the most fun I've had with a camera. One year, and one hundred and one thousand images later, I'm still having fun, but I have to qualify it. It's enormous fun, but you have to work for it.

The A1 is not a simple camera to use, because it gives you so much control over its abilities. This is not a camera to get lazy with. Get the A1 if you enjoy the process of taking the photograph and all the way through the final image. If you pay attention, the A1 will reward you with images. Sharp, beautifully focussed, images, in rapid sequence, with the A1 adjusting the focus in between every image. Doing it all in complete silence. Of all the cameras I've owned, this one most feels like it is intended for people who do NOT want to "just point the camera at it and click". To use a car metaphor: if you are wanting a car to visit the supermarket and get to work, you do not want a high-end sports car - the sports car is for someone who wants to enjoy the experience, and who will be paying attention to each detail of the driving experience; stop paying attention and you'll wrap the sports car around a tree - it is relying on you to control it. Fortunately, the A1 isn't that dangerous, but it has let me mess up on an epic level and on more images than ever before! There's nothing quite as mortifying as getting home and having to look at 100 images, all mis-focused because I locked focus on a tree branch. At least I know who's at fault - the A1 is just doing what I told it to do. Makes me determined to be more careful the next time, and watch the focus while I'm shooting.

Does everyone need an A1? No. Please don't think that I'm telling you that you must go and get one. There are quite a few cameras out there, and many people don't need (or want) what an A1 can do. I have tried to show you some of what an A1 can do (and carefully hidden almost all of my mistakes!), so you can get a feeling of why you might want one. An important warning: do not buy an A1 if it means you are spending every cent on the body. If you are going to use the A1 to its best, you are going to want some really good lenses, and possibly some new memory cards (which are currently rather expensive), and you may well need to buy more disk space (I did). I even ended up buying a new photo processing computer, so I could process more images in less time.

Do you need Sony GM lenses with an A1? No. I've posted images shot with the Voigtl√§nder APO Lanthar 50mm f/2, for example, which is a fine lens, and not expensive, and it works very well on the A1. One of the joys of the Sony E mount is the large number of lenses which you can use, in both native E mount, and via adapters. There are A1 shooters who are using no Sony lenses at all. I am, but I like a lot of Sony lenses. You can use any lens you like, but sooner or later you'll want to have at least one really good lens.

I'd characterise the A1 as a brilliant camera for the keen enthusiast. Someone who has used a number of cameras, and knows what they want, and really wants it! Someone who will learn about their camera, and go to the trouble to set it up "just right". Importantly, I would never recommend that someone start with an A1 as their first camera, because it is just too complicated.

What's better than an A1? Er, two A1s and an unlimited lens budget? OK, what is as good? If you are a Nikon shooter, the Z9 is the obvious choice - a Z9 shooter was telling me about his. and how it replaced both a D850 and a D5, and I got the feeling he is enjoying it (almost) as much as I'm enjoying the A1. If you shoot Canon, then maybe the R3, or the as-yet-unannounced camera they have hinted at. I am not really the best person to ask. In the past I have used high-end Canon (1Ds III), Nikon (D810), and Leica (M9) cameras, and the A1 is better (for me!) than any camera I have used before (it's also better than all the Sony cameras I've used before, I must point out). Does that mean I will stop looking at other cameras? No, but don't tell my A1 that!

It has been quite a year, and I have learned a lot. I am sure my photography has improved, because the camera has demanded that I improve.
camera are the ports. It's nice to see a full-size HDMI socket, but the rest is pretty much unchanged, just a bit rearranged.

The dials on the top left shoulder are very like the A9 II, except that the AF dial's lock is at the back instead of the front, and the drive mode dial has H+ as well as H, M, and L. The controls on the top right seem unchanged, which suits me, because I am familiar with them.

The first big change comes when you power on the camera. The menus are very different, and that's not a bad thing. I am not going to say that the old menus were terrible, but they weren't particularly well organised, and there were some functions that seemed to be in the wrong place. These new menus have been carefully thought out, including the decision to put the My Menu pages first - once you have gathered the menus you want into My Menu, you won't be venturing into the other menus often. The menus are grouped into seven colour-coded sections, with a couple of the sections containing more than a page of submenus - there are 57 submenus in all. Some of those submenus also extend for more than a page - Image Quality (where you choose the file formats you want to use, and file sizes) has 11 entries, for example. Some of those entries display pages of their own - for example, Custom Key Setting for stills has four pages showing every button that can be customised and what it is set to. It is well-thought out, and includes images of the camera labelling every button or dial you can assign. I was impressed by how much work they had put into improving the menu system. One of the best parts is that they have made it easy to save all of your customisation onto a memory card, so you can, for example, customise your first A1 perfectly, then just copy those settings into all your other A1 cameras... (or more likely, you can save all your settings if you have to send your camera in for service).

One thing that hasn't changed is the rear screen. It's exactly the same as it was on the A9 II, the A7R IV, and the A7R III. I say was, because the A7R IV and A7R III are being re-released with a new higher resolution rear screen as the A7R IVa and A7R IIIa.

The next obvious change is the EVF - the A1 has scored a major upgrade in the viewfinder, getting a 9 million dot screen that supports high speed and very high speed modes. It's a delight. They made one change that may have been a mistake, moving the eye sensor (which controls switching from rear screen to EVF) from the top to the bottom of the eye cup - there are reports of the sensor not switching to the EVF when there is bright light coming from one side. It has happened to me (just once), so I know it's real.

The A1 is a little bit heavier than its siblings, but I honestly could not tell. Hold the A7R IV and A1 in each hand and they feel very much the same weight.

All in all, I think Sony did a very good job of making the A1 familiar to users of their current cameras - the controls are where I expect them to be. The menus are very different, but I can capture the commands I need often to My Menu, so I don't need the menus all that often.

### First impressions

The A1 arrives in a box the same size as the A7R III, the A7R IV, or the A9 II - it seems Sony has standardised the packaging of these cameras. The box contains the documentation, a USB-C cable (but no multi-USB cable), a clamp for tethering cables, the usual battery charger, the usual FZ100 battery, and a camera strap - no surprises there.

The shape of the body is already familiar to the users of the A7R IV, the A9 II, or the A7S III. All these bodies using the same battery grip, so I guess it makes sense that they are very much the same. I gather that the A1 is a little deeper, but you wouldn't know it by looking.

#### Changed and unchanged

There is yet another way of opening the memory card compartment, but that is something that seems to change often on Sony. Inside the compartment is the first noticeable change: you can load SD cards into the two card slots in the usual way (label away from you), or you can load the new CFexpress Type A cards (label towards you). If you want top speed buffer clearing, you'll want to buy one or two CFexpress cards, because they are more than twice the speed of the best SD cards, but they are, like all new memory cards, quite pricy at the moment, and you can get most of the speed of the A1 with good SD cards.

On the opposite end of the camera are the ports. It's nice to see a full-size HDMI socket, but the rest is pretty much unchanged, just a bit rearranged.

The dials on the top left shoulder are very like the A9 II, except that the AF dial's lock is at the back instead of the front, and the drive mode dial has H+ as well as H, M, and L. The controls on the top right seem unchanged, which suits me, because I am familiar with them.

The first big change comes when you power on the camera. The menus are very different, and that's not a bad thing. I am not going to say that the old menus were terrible, but they weren't particularly well organised, and there were some functions that seemed to be in the wrong place.

(or more likely, you can save all your settings if you have to send your camera in for service). Also, you can save one setup, then experiment, save the results, and switch between the different setups.

One thing that hasn't changed is the rear screen. It's exactly the same as it was on the A9 II, the A7R IV, and the A7R III. I say was, because the A7R IV and A7R III are being re-released with a new higher resolution rear screen as the A7R IVa and A7R IIIa.

The menus are very different, but I can capture the commands I need often to My Menu, so I don't need the menus all that often. I have dipped my toe into customising this camera, more than I have the previous Sonys, but I can tell I will need to do more.

## Usage Impressions

## Review Situations

In this review, I used the camera in a variety of situations, . Each situation is a separate article that can be clicked below.

## Conclusion

I ordered the A1 sight-unseen on the day it was announced, hoping that it would live up to my expectations. My expectations were high, because this camera looked like it combined what I liked about the A9 II (the extra controls, the black-out free shooting, the high speed) with everything I loved about the A7R IV (mainly the high resolution and the clarity of the sensor without an AA filter).

I got more than I expected. I was not expecting the luxury of the new EVF. I was not expecting how much learning was involved in this new camera. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it this much. The A1 is fun! It is also a bit of a pain, because it's really easy to shoot thousands of frames with lots of repetition. No hassle at the time of shooting, but it gets tedious to cull the images when you get home!

The A1 is not "The One" that Sony Marketing called it. It is not the only camera you need. It's not the only camera everyone should buy. It's not a complete replacement for the entire Alpha range. What it is, however, is a lovely example of what Sony can do when they unleash their development team. The A1 may have been intended to be a halo product - the unattainable high end product that exists to make the rest of the product line look less expensive - but it failed, because it's not unattainable. Yes, it's expensive, but it's not so expensive that people aren't buying it. Admittedly, that may have been exacerbated by the fact that people have not been spending their money on travel / tourism due to the pandemic, so they have a bit more available to spend. It may even be that Sony has a problem building enough A1 cameras to satisfy demand.

, and I used it for a month before writing this review, because I wanted to be certain that I was giving you a reasonable assessment.

I bought this camera on release because I wanted a camera which I could rely on to photograph birds, and other things in motion. I am very glad I did.
