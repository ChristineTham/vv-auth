The Allan Bridge, located between Glenbawn and Segenhoe, is the most significant heritage bridge in the Upper Hunter Shire and one of five timber heritage bridges in the Shire. It was constructed in 1937, was washed away in 1955 and reconstructed at a site further downstream. The foundations of the bridge buckled in 2016 due to an overweight truck.
