This is a Real Life Review of the new Voigtländer 75mm f1.5 VM-mount lens with Leica M10 and Sony A7r bodies, taken at the Klang Snake Temple and Johor Zoo in Malaysia, and at the Auburn Botanic Garden Cherry Blossom Festival.

This review focuses on the ability of the lens to take animal and human portraits, as well as object photography.

## Usage Impressions

The lens fits snugly and feels well balanced on both the Leica M10 and Sony A7r. Focusing is relative easy, although I've found the focus dial turns quite easy and therefore the camera has a slight tendency to drift out of focus if you move the camera in between shots.

## 天福宫 Tian Hock Kung Snake Temple

This is a famous temple nestled right underneath the new Klang River Bridge in Malaysia, containing lots of motifs of snakes and a real live python inside. Andy Lau, the famous Hong Kong actor, reportedly once visited this popular temple. This is a good opportunity for object photography and testing the depth of field object isolation capabilities of this lens.

## Johor Zoo

Considered the oldest zoo in SE Asia, and quite possibly Asia, Johor Zoo was established in 1928 by the Sultan of Johor as a private zoo, but subsequently opened to the public and now managed by the state government. One of the advantages of being an older style zoo is that we can get really close to the animals which makes for great photos, even on a modest telephoto lens such as the Nokton 75mm

### Birds

All these shots are taken through a wire mesh, and shows how the shallow depth of field (shot at max aperture f1.5) effectively "hides" the wire mesh.

### Camel, Banting and Asian Brown Tortoise

The lens is able to isolate animals in open air scenarios, as long as it is possible to get relatively close to the animal.

### Tiger

These shots were taken from above looking down into the tigers. They were fairly active and frisky in the morning, so it was a good opportunity to take action shots. It was relatively easy to focus on the moving animals, although once or twice I missed focus.

### African Lion

Similar these shots are also taken from above, although the lions were very perceptive and noticed my shutter sound, which is why on many of these photos the animal appears to be looking at the lens.

### Sun Bear

The sun bear was shot from a quite a distance away, which explains the lack of bokeh and most of the shots have been cropped.

## Auburn Cherry Blossom Festival

This magnificent Japanese garden was a good opportunity to test the portrait capabilities of the lens (human and animal subjects).
